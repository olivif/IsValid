# IsValid
A library influanced by [https://github.com/AlexArchive/Validator](AlexArchive/Validator) and [https://github.com/chriso/validator.js](chriso/validator.js) but provides the functions via a fluent extension based api.

Some/most of the initial validation code is taken directly from [https://github.com/AlexArchive/Validator](AlexArchive/Validator) but repackaged into a more fluent/extension based validation api.
